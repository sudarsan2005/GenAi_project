Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to recognize patterns or make predictions, generative AI creates original outputs based on the patterns it has learned during training.\n","\n","    ### Key Concepts in Generative AI:\n","\n","    - *Large Language Models (LLMs)*: Text generation systems like GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude, etc.\n","    - *Diffusion Models*: For image generation (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)\n","    - *Prompt Engineering*: The art of crafting inputs to get desired outputs\n","    - *Fine-tuning*: Adapting pre-trained models for specific domains or tasks\n","    - *RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)*: Method for aligning AI with human preferences\n","\n","    Learning generative AI involves understanding these foundation models, how they work, and how to effectively use and customize them for various applications.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","def add_agentic_ai_info():\n","    \"\"\"Return information about Agentic AI\"\"\"\n","    return \"\"\"\n","    ## What is Agentic AI?\n","\n","    Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can act autonomously to achieve specified goals.
